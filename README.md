# Java-Sample
My name is Tyreek Jones. I'm from Sumter, SC. I'm a second year senior at Coastal Carolina University. I am expected to graduate at the end of this semester. I'm creating this GitHub for my senior assesment class. I have attached a complete java program that will compute the area of a rectangle and a circle. This was the only "project" that I could find. I hope it is sufficient.
